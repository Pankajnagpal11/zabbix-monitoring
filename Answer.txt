 Ansible is good for most configuration changes, audits, repetitive tasks across multiple devices. Ansible is a tool which is written in Python and is therefore easy to extend if you know Python. With ansible one can completely automate the “deploy and operate” stages of the DevOps lifecycle. Zabbix export template script which can be written in python wil be around 100 lines of code where as in Ansible it is around 20 lines making code compact, easy of maintain and less error prone. Wherever we have libraries available we should Ansible else we should fallback to python.
